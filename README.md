### \*CURRENTLY BEING PORTED OVER FROM OLD OBJECTIVE-C CODE ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Aptly named after one of the greatest animators of all time, Walt is part of a larger effort to open source [Giffy](https://appsto.re/us/gSgd2.i).

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

Walt is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Walt"
```

## License

Walt is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more info.

## Notes

As of right now, this is simply a direct Swift 3 port of existing code that I had – the original code is like 2+ years old. There will need to be a few more things before I can call this v1.0:

1. Unit Tests with extensive code coverage
2. A cleaner example app that showcases the supported features

Also, more than anything this library gives me the ability to isolate and modularize a lot of the functionality inside of some of my existing apps. With that being said, many of the features added to this will be influenced by goals I have with apps that use this. If for some reason this actually gets starred and used, other developers will be influencing that as well :)
